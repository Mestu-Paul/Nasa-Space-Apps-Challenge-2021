# Space Agency Data
We will use NASA API for getting the present world temperature map. For observing the hampered agricultural region, we will use GIOVANNI data resources along with monitoring drought we will use NASA DROUGHT MONITOR MAPS. In a particular area of the earth, whether the temperature has crossed the retention capacity or not we will use Goddard Earth Science and Data Information Service Center and will provide an alarm. 

 

A user feeds the data in the mobile application named Heat Alarm according to Type of Infrastructure, Observers Name, damage extent, temperature level, description, Location using GPS, Geotag photo related damage occurred in health due to high temperature. The data is sent to the server and stored in the database. The database is linked to the dashboard for authority, where that data can be visualized. Then authorities apply the Satellite Image Damage Detection Algorithm to the location reported by crowdsource data and find out the extent of damage caused in that particular structure.

 

For this solution, we will use NASA Space App Data Resources. We can use BRAZILIAN SPACE AGENCY (AEB) RESOURCES to get an idea of ​​the direction of the Earth's temperature.

We will use another satellite named CANADIAN SPACE AGENCY (CSA) RESOURCES for radiometer and measuring atmospheric composition.
